# Mineral Salt classifier
## Abstract
> The conventional techniques of mineral identification mainly involve making use of manual features of minerals under a microscope. The project uses a dataset containing images of minerals in 7 classes taken from Kaggle. The data augmentation techniques were used and  VGG-16 & VGG-19 CNN was used to get the best training accuracy of 73.43% and test accuracy of 70.89%. The model was trained and saved using Keras, Tensorflow and implemented on real-time and static images using OpenCV.
## Tools Used
- keras
